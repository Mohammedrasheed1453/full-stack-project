I have created an Event management system for our university with the help of html,css,js,bootstrap and flask.
where the event orgainser can organise their events and upload the events in the dashboard and the students can login using their university credentials and register for the events that they are desired.
the organizer can able to see the all registered students also with event name.
The all designing and frontend part was done using HTML+CSS+BOOTSTRAP and BACKEND WITH FLASK AND MYSQL
